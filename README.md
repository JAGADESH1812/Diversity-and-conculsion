# Diversity-and-conculsion
Diversity and inclusion (D&I) in organizations focus on creating a workplace environment that values and respects differences among individuals.
This involves fostering an equitable and inclusive culture where employees from varied backgrounds, abilities, and perspectives feel welcomed, supported, 
and empowered to contribute to the organizationâ€™s success.
